=============
git checkout -b branch_name <!-- creates the new branch with a specified name -->
git checkout master <!-- will move you back into the master folder -->
fit checkout branch_name <!-- will move you into the branch -->

A branch is a copy of your master at that point in time until changes are made to one or the other. You will probably merge them again at some point.
